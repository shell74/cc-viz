# cc-viz
CodeCademy Data Visualization Project
# This mini project was to be able to see what was needed for a song to have high energy.
# I wanted to vizualize the data to display any possible relationships for the energy of a song.
# I found that the strongest correlation linked to energy of a song was the loudness, the louder a song, the less energy it produced
# The closer the value of loudness was to zero, the higher the energy was for that song, on average
# The highest energy genres were: psytrance, trap, hardstyle
# The lowest loudness genres were: trap, dnb, hardstyle
#2 out of 3 genres overlap, the best enerygy with lowest loudness are trap and hardstyle
